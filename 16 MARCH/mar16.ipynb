    "Q1: Define overfitting and underfitting in machine learning. What are the consequences of each, and how can they be mitigated?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overfitting: Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data too well, capturing noise and random fluctuations in the data rather than general patterns. As a result, the model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data. Consequences of overfitting include poor performance on test data, decreased model interpretability, and increased computational resources required during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Underfitting: Underfitting happens when a model is too simplistic to capture the underlying patterns in the data. It results in poor performance on both training and test data. An underfit model might be too generalized and fails to learn important relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate overfitting and underfitting, several techniques can be employed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cross-Validation: Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to assess model performance on multiple data splits, ensuring a more robust evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Regularization: Introduce penalties for large coefficients or complex models, discouraging overfitting. Common regularization techniques include L1 and L2 regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Feature Selection: Choose relevant and informative features while eliminating noisy or irrelevant ones to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Early Stopping: Monitor the model's performance during training and stop when the performance on the validation set starts to degrade, preventing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Ensemble Methods: Combine multiple models to reduce overfitting. Techniques like bagging and boosting can help improve generalization.\n",

    "\n",
    "The bias-variance tradeoff is a fundamental concept in machine learning that refers to the balance between a model's bias (simplification assumptions) and variance (sensitivity to training data). Understanding this tradeoff is crucial in designing effective machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bias: Bias represents the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem with a simplified model. High bias implies that the model is making overly simplistic assumptions and is likely to underfit the data.\n",

    "- Variance: Variance refers to the model's sensitivity to variations in the training data. High variance implies that the model is very complex and overfits the training data, capturing noise and fluctuations.\n",

    "- High bias models tend to have low variance, but they may fail to capture important patterns in the data.\n",
