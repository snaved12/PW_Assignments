    "A database is a structured collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. Databases are used in various applications, including websites, mobile apps, and enterprise systems, to store and retrieve data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL are two broad categories of databases that differ in their data model, storage, and query languages. Here are the key differences between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data model: SQL databases are based on the relational data model, where data is organized into tables with predefined columns and rows. Each row represents a single record, and each column represents a specific attribute of that record. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, use various data models, such as key-value, document, column-family, or graph, to store data in a more flexible and scalable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema: SQL databases have a predefined schema, which defines the structure of the data, the data types, and the relationships between tables. This means that any data inserted into the database must conform to the schema. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, do not have a fixed schema and can accommodate different types of data with varying structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Query language: SQL databases use SQL (Structured Query Language) to retrieve, update, and delete data from tables. SQL is a standardized language that is widely used and understood by database developers and administrators. NoSQL databases use different query languages, depending on their data model. For example, MongoDB, a document-based NoSQL database, uses a query language called MongoDB Query Language (MQL).\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally, meaning that they can handle large amounts of data and traffic by adding more servers to a cluster. SQL databases can also scale, but they typically require more complex setup and maintenance to achieve high scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "ACID compliance: SQL databases are generally ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) compliant, which means that they ensure data consistency and reliability even in the face of system failures or concurrent transactions. NoSQL databases, however, sacrifice some ACID properties in favor of scalability and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, SQL databases are ideal for applications that require strict data consistency and complex querying capabilities, while NoSQL databases are better suited for applications that require high scalability and flexibility in data modeling."

    "The order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "FROM - specifies the table or tables to retrieve data from\n",
    "JOIN - combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them\n",
    "WHERE - specifies the conditions that the retrieved data must meet\n",
    "GROUP BY - groups the retrieved data based on one or more columns\n",
    "HAVING - specifies the conditions that the grouped data must meet\n",
    "SELECT - specifies the columns to retrieve from the table(s)\n",
