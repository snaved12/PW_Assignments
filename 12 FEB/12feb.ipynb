    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. When an exception occurs, Python raises an error and halts the program execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several built-in exception types in Python, such as ValueError, TypeError, IndexError, NameError, FileNotFoundError, ZeroDivisionError, etc. Each exception type corresponds to a specific error condition that can occur during program execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some differences between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions are errors that occur during program execution, whereas syntax errors occur before the program runs, due to incorrect syntax in the code.\n",
    "Exceptions are handled by using try and except blocks in the code, while syntax errors must be fixed in the code before the program can be executed.\n",
    "Exceptions can occur at any point during program execution, whereas syntax errors prevent the program from being executed at all.\n",
    "In general, exceptions can occur due to various reasons such as invalid input, incorrect program logic, errors accessing external resources (such as files or network), etc. It is important to handle exceptions properly in the code to ensure that the program continues to run correctly even in the presence of errors. This involves catching and handling specific exceptions that can occur in the code, and taking appropriate actions to recover from them."
