    "C) Artificial Intelligence:\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and perform tasks like humans. AI involves the development of computer systems that can learn from experience, recognize patterns, understand natural language, and make decisions with little or no human intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: One popular example of AI is virtual personal assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, or Alexa. These assistants can understand spoken language, process queries, and provide relevant information or perform actions based on the user's request.\n",
    "\n",
    "<) Machine Learning:\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms that enable computers to learn and improve their performance on a specific task without being explicitly programmed. In machine learning, the system learns from data, identifies patterns, and makes predictions or decisions based on the learned patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A common application of machine learning is email spam filtering. ML algorithms can analyze large datasets of emails labeled as spam or non-spam to learn patterns distinguishing between the two. Once trained, the system can accurately classify new incoming emails as either spam or not, based on the learned patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "I) Deep Learning:\n",
    "Deep Learning is a specialized subset of machine learning that involves training artificial neural networks to perform complex tasks. These neural networks are designed to mimic the structure and functioning of the human brain, with multiple layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) to process and learn from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Image recognition is a classic example of deep learning. Deep neural networks, known as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), can be trained on vast datasets of labeled images to identify objects, animals, or people in new images. For instance, a deep learning model can be trained to recognize cats in pictures, and once trained, it can accurately identify cats in new images it hasn't seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "These three concepts, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning, are interconnected and represent different levels of complexity in building intelligent systems. AI is the broader field that encompasses the other two, while Machine Learning and Deep Learning are more specialized techniques used within the realm of AI."

The validation set helps to compare different hyperparameter configurations and select the best-performing model."
